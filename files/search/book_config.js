Without a doubt, the COVID-19 lockdown period put many of Selangor\u2019s and Malaysia\u2019s \u000d\u000apriorities on the backburner as the primary aim was to save lives and livelihoods. Now, it is time to redouble our efforts towards our \u000d\u000aEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) responsibilities.\u000d\u000aIn Malaysia, we are constantly reminded of climate change\u2019s environmental and social impacts due to the risk of seasonal floods \u000d\u000aafflicting our country.\u000d\u000aCHAIRMAN'S NOTE\u000d\u000aIn 2022, it was \u000d\u000aestimated by the \u000d\u000aDepartment of \u000d\u000aStatistics Malaysia \u000d\u000athat damage caused \u000d\u000aby the floods cost \u000d\u000athe nation RM600 \u000d\u000amillion.\u000d\u000aAt Air Selangor, we believe that it \u000d\u000ais paramount for all stakeholders \u000d\u000ato collectively reduce our carbon \u000d\u000afootprint and mitigate the impact of \u000d\u000aclimate change to save our planet\u2019s \u000d\u000afuture.\u000d\u000aTherefore, I am pleased to note that \u000d\u000aAir Selangor\u2019s third Sustainability \u000d\u000aReport magnifies our commitment \u000d\u000ato upholding and striving towards \u000d\u000arealising the United Nations \u000d\u000aSustainable Development Goals \u000d\u000a(UN SDGs), and reflects our pursuit of \u000d\u000aa better place for future generations. \u000d\u000aAs the nation\u2019s largest water operator \u000d\u000aand a responsible corporate citizen, \u000d\u000aAir Selangor\u2019s ESG practices are at the \u000d\u000aforefront of our business and aims \u000d\u000ato steer the organisation forward to \u000d\u000aaddress our environmental and social \u000d\u000arisks.","CHAIRMAN\u2019S NOTE\u000d\u000a5\u000d\u000aSustainability Report 2022\u000d\u000aThe Selangor state\u2019s 10-year \u000d\u000aplan has included initiatives \u000d\u000ato study the feasibility of \u000d\u000atapping into new water \u000d\u000abodies, such as lakes and to \u000d\u000acreate an interconnected \u000d\u000asystem that links lakes, with \u000d\u000arivers to strengthen water \u000d\u000asecurity further.\u000d\u000aTo combat this, improvement \u000d\u000ain water delivery mechanisms \u000d\u000acan help in reducing NRW from \u000d\u000a28.6% in 2020 to the target of \u000d\u000a25% in 2025. While Air Selangor \u000d\u000ahas committed our efforts to \u000d\u000asustainably reducing NRW, I want \u000d\u000athe group to redouble their efforts \u000d\u000ato further reduce NRW, especially \u000d\u000aonce construction of the \u000d\u000atreatment plants in the pipeline \u000d\u000ais near completion.\u000d\u000aAir Selangor also supports the \u000d\u000aSelangor government\u2019s Skim Air Darul \u000d\u000aEhsan (SADE), which is to ensure equal \u000d\u000aaccess to clean water for all, especially \u000d\u000aby aiding the low-income households \u000d\u000awith the entitlement of 20m\u00b3 of water \u000d\u000asupply monthly for free. In 2022, the \u000d\u000autility company processed 23,553 \u000d\u000aapplications, and 301,549 recipients \u000d\u000abenefitted from the SADE programme, \u000d\u000awith the Selangor State Government \u000d\u000abearing more than RM30 million \u000d\u000ain costs.\u000d\u000aFocusing on Water Security\u000d\u000aWater scarcity is a major threat and \u000d\u000apresents one of the biggest challenges \u000d\u000aof urbanisation. When coupled with \u000d\u000aincreasingly extreme swings between \u000d\u000adroughts and floods, the management \u000d\u000aof water resources becomes even more \u000d\u000acomplicated. The effects of climate \u000d\u000achange have also altered hydrological \u000d\u000acharacteristics and with critical local \u000d\u000awater sources not being preserved, there \u000d\u000ais significant pressure on available water \u000d\u000areserves.\u000d\u000aIn the context of the global economy, \u000d\u000athe situation affects essential industries, \u000d\u000afrom food and energy production \u000d\u000ato displacement of people through \u000d\u000amigration. According to the World \u000d\u000aBank, more than 216 million people are \u000d\u000aexpected to move within and out of their \u000d\u000acountries to avoid climate change-related \u000d\u000adisasters. Water security is now a national \u000d\u000asecurity issue and water scarcity is \u000d\u000aestimated to cost some regions up to 6% \u000d\u000aof their Gross Domestic Product (GDP). \u000d\u000aIn Malaysia\u2019s context, water pollution \u000d\u000ahas been a threat to the security of water \u000d\u000asupply, whether caused by accidents or \u000d\u000aon purpose. In 2022 alone, there were \u000d\u000ainstances where Selangor and Kuala \u000d\u000aLumpur were severely affected and left \u000d\u000awithout water supply for days due to \u000d\u000arepeated pollution incidents in our rivers. \u000d\u000aIt is estimated that water disruptions \u000d\u000ahave an economic impact of billions of \u000d\u000aringgit due to lost productivity, revenue \u000d\u000aand remediation costs.\u000d\u000aTherefore, I believe it should be a top \u000d\u000apriority for all stakeholders to take \u000d\u000athe right actions to protect our water \u000d\u000aresources. Proactive steps to increase \u000d\u000araw water storage, greater enforcement \u000d\u000aand monitoring of our rivers, more \u000d\u000aefficient use of our water, and improving \u000d\u000aour water reserve margin while reducing \u000d\u000anon-revenue water are all important \u000d\u000ainitiatives that we must continue to \u000d\u000asupport and build on.\u000d\u000aChairman's Note","CHAIRMAN\u2019S NOTE\u000d\u000a6\u000d\u000aPengurusan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd\u000d\u000aImproving Water Security\u000d\u000aIn our mission to become a leading water services company in \u000d\u000aAsia by 2030, Air Selangor is highly cognisant and prepared to \u000d\u000atake the lead in addressing and tackling the water security issue \u000d\u000afor our stakeholders\u2019 best interests. As a major player in the \u000d\u000aindustry, Air Selangor can play a role in calling for and supporting \u000d\u000aeffective frameworks and mechanisms that position water as \u000d\u000athe most essential element for sustainable economic, social and \u000d\u000aenvironmental development. \u000d\u000aThe Selangor government\u2019s Raw Water Guarantee Scheme \u000d\u000a(SJAM), which was introduced to tackle the state\u2019s water \u000d\u000apollution and insufficient raw water issues, is an initiative to look \u000d\u000aforward to. With the dedicated infrastructure to reroute water \u000d\u000afrom the off-river storage to the treatment plant, thus \u000d\u000apreventing polluted water from flowing into the same plant, \u000d\u000aSJAM will begin to solve a huge burden of water disruption \u000d\u000aand make Selangor\u2019s water supply system more resilient. \u000d\u000aIn addition to SJAM, the Selangor state\u2019s 10-year plan has \u000d\u000aincluded initiatives to study the feasibility of tapping into new \u000d\u000awater bodies, such as lakes, and to create an interconnected \u000d\u000asystem that links lakes with rivers to strengthen water security \u000d\u000afurther. With the interconnectivity of water bodies, our water \u000d\u000asupply system serves a dual purpose; increasing supply and \u000d\u000amitigating the threat of floods.\u000d\u000aBuilding resilient frameworks and effective mechanisms also \u000d\u000ainvolves policies that can help to prevent water shortages, \u000d\u000aespecially by implementing regulations to curb water pollution \u000d\u000aand promoting awareness on water security. Air Selangor fully \u000d\u000asupports the Polluter Pays Principle which is reflected in the \u000d\u000areadiness of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment \u000d\u000aand Climate Change to amend the Water Services Industry Act \u000d\u000a2006 (Act 655). The amendment of the Act is slated to increase \u000d\u000afines and impose heavier penalties on polluters commensurate \u000d\u000awith the disruptions they have caused, while conveying a strong \u000d\u000amessage that maintaining the integrity of our water sources is \u000d\u000anon-negotiable.\u000d\u000aPlaying Our Part as a Responsible Water Utility Operator\u000d\u000aAs mapped out in the First Selangor Plan (2021-2025), in \u000d\u000apreparation for the state\u2019s transformation into a Smart City, the \u000d\u000aissue of Non-Revenue Water (NRW) must be addressed. NRW \u000d\u000aposes challenges to the operator to ensure that clean, safe and \u000d\u000asufficient water is supplied to the consumers. To combat this, \u000d\u000aimprovement in water delivery mechanisms can help in reducing \u000d\u000aNRW from 28.6% in 2020 to the target of 25% in 2025. While \u000d\u000aAir Selangor has committed our efforts to sustainably reducing \u000d\u000aNRW, I want the group to redouble their efforts to further reduce \u000d\u000aNRW, especially once construction of the treatment plants in the \u000d\u000apipeline is near completion.\u000d\u000aRobust infrastructure can also address NRW and other factors \u000d\u000athat lead to water disruptions. While Air Selangor acknowledges \u000d\u000athat we have inherited an ageing infrastructure from previous \u000d\u000awater operators, we are ready to invest in a sustainable business \u000d\u000amodel to meet the growing demands of consumers in the long \u000d\u000aterm. The organisation is strategically developing infrastructure \u000d\u000aby ensuring timely upgrades of assets and operational efficiency \u000d\u000aand is also leveraging on digitalisation to further drive efficiency \u000d\u000aand business governance. As it moves into the area of Artificial \u000d\u000aIntelligence solutions, Air Selangor is confident that we will \u000d\u000abe more efficient with the help of real-time insights that will \u000d\u000aenhance day-to-day activities and processes.\u000d\u000aAir Selangor also supports the Selangor government\u2019s Skim Air \u000d\u000aDarul Ehsan (SADE), which is to ensure equal access to clean \u000d\u000awater for all, especially by aiding the low-income households \u000d\u000awith an entitlement of 20m\u00b3 of water supply monthly for free. \u000d\u000aIn 2022, the utility company processed 23,553 applications, and \u000d\u000a301,549 recipients benefitted from the SADE programme, with \u000d\u000athe Selangor State Government bearing more than RM30 million \u000d\u000ain costs.\u000d\u000aChairman's Note\u000d\u000aRasau Water Supply Scheme Dual-Function Off-River Storage","CHAIRMAN\u2019S NOTE\u000d\u000a7\u000d\u000aSustainability Report 2022\u000d\u000aThe Company is aware of and values its collaborations and \u000d\u000apartnerships with various stakeholders and supply chain, which \u000d\u000ahave been instrumental in ensuring sustainable water security. \u000d\u000aStrategic partnerships can help by leveraging on resources \u000d\u000aand expertise of different stakeholders and promoting joint \u000d\u000adecision-making and action. This can lead to improved water \u000d\u000agovernance, more efficient water use, and better coordination of \u000d\u000aefforts to address water-related challenges.\u000d\u000aFor instance, Air Selangor has intensified its efforts by increasing \u000d\u000athe water reserve margin and conducting a water reclamation \u000d\u000ainitiative with Indah Water Konsortium Sdn. Bhd. (IWK). IWK\u2019s \u000d\u000arole includes treating bioeffluent at its wastewater treatment \u000d\u000aplants before being redistributed via Air Selangor to consumers \u000d\u000athrough a dedicated pipe network for non-potable use. To \u000d\u000acombat water pollution cases, Air Selangor works closely with \u000d\u000aLembaga Urus Air Selangor (LUAS) to ensure that critical areas \u000d\u000aare under 24-hour surveillance to mitigate the risk of water \u000d\u000asupply disruption caused by illegal dumping and pollution. We \u000d\u000aalso continue to create awareness through education by jointly \u000d\u000apromoting water conservation with State Assemblymen (ADUN), \u000d\u000areligious organisations, educational institutions, and other \u000d\u000aprogrammes with various non-governmental organisations. \u000d\u000aStepping into the Future as One\u000d\u000aAs Air Selangor accelerates its journey towards sustainability \u000d\u000aand continues to advocate and educate on the importance of \u000d\u000awater security, the organisation understands it must think and act \u000d\u000aon its feet to reduce threats posed by climate change and rapid \u000d\u000aurbanisation. However, we strongly believe that as a collective \u000d\u000aunit, we can confidently tackle future challenges and grow to be \u000d\u000abetter prepared and equipped for the future.\u000d\u000aI would like to thank our consumers for their support and the \u000d\u000aopportunity to serve an essential component of their lives. I \u000d\u000athank the Board for helping to guide Air Selangor towards the \u000d\u000aright business path, especially in times of difficulties, through \u000d\u000atheir wisdom and sound advice. I express my gratitude to \u000d\u000athe Management Team and employees of Air Selangor as they \u000d\u000acontinue to dedicate their energies to delivering value.

This \u000d\u000ahas pushed us towards mitigating and managing climate \u000d\u000achange while continuing to strengthen our business to create \u000d\u000along-term positive impacts for the community and \u000d\u000aenvironment.

It is a measure of a water utility\u2019s \u000d\u000aability to meet future water demand and is paramount in ensuring that customers have \u000d\u000aan adequate water supply during times of drought or unexpected demand.

Through the Physical Loss Reduction Programme, 151.4 MLD worth of \u000d\u000aleaks were reduced through pipe replacement, active leak detection, and pressure \u000d\u000amanagement. Air Selangor\u2019s pipe replacement project began in 2016 and as of December \u000d\u000a2022, a total of 621.67 km pipes had been replaced. In addition, the Commercial Loss \u000d\u000aReduction Programme managed to reduce 58.8 MLD worth of water losses through \u000d\u000ameter replacement and meter relocation. \u000d\u000aIn 2022, Air Selangor also initiated the smart meter pilot project aimed at reducing \u000d\u000aNRW more effectively. This involved the installation of 2,393 smart meters across 467 \u000d\u000acommercial premises and 1,926 residential premises. Although the project is at the pilot \u000d\u000astage, it has shown significant potential in Acoustic Leak Detection. \u000d\u000aIn the same year, Air Selangor also commissioned an NRW Assessment study to evaluate \u000d\u000acurrent initiatives and to further identify impactful strategies which would result in \u000d\u000aNRW targets being achieved. Some of the initiatives planned include the deployment \u000d\u000aof 50,000 smart meters, implementing a regimented active leak detection monitoring \u000d\u000aprogramme, and accelerating pipeline replacement.

Air Selangor generated 48,300.85 MT of \u000d\u000aresiduals in 2022. The large volume of residuals disposed of \u000d\u000ain the previous years was caused by the desilting process in SSP2 \u000d\u000aWTP residual lagoon. As the process has been completed by \u000d\u000athe end of 2021, the lagoon had a sufficient area to store and \u000d\u000atreat residuals before being disposed of at the approved landfill \u000d\u000aarea. The SSP2 WTP will also be installed with a temporary \u000d\u000aresidual treatment facility in 2023, to minimise the discharge \u000d\u000aof effluent into the lagoon and to allow for the direct disposal \u000d\u000aof residuals into the landfill area.\u000d\u000aMoving towards the Zero Waste Environment target and applying \u000d\u000athe concept of a circular economy within our operations, Air \u000d\u000aSelangor engaged Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM) to \u000d\u000astudy the potential use of residuals as a soil enhancer for forested \u000d\u000aareas. \u000d\u000aAir Selangor also applies its waste management procedures in \u000d\u000ahandling the other scheduled waste and domestic waste.
